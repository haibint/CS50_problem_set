1.  stdint.h gives me BMP-related data types based on Microsoft's own (gives me addtional data structures.)

2.  The point here is to make the size of data strutures from stdint.h clear.

3.  8, 32, 32, 16

4.  acsii: BM, decimal: 66;77 hexadecimal: 42, 4d

5.  One is Bitmapfile size and the another one is bitmapinfosize

6.  I don't know
7.  Bibitcount
8.  If the  user put a filename that doesn't exist
9.  because we just want to read one size of the "things" once at a time.
10. 2
11. skip over padding
12. Current position of the file pointer
